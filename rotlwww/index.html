                    <span class="question">In the begining, there was the idea.</span><br>
                    The <acronym title="Super Nintendo Entertainment System">SNES</ACRONYM> was one of the best
                    consoles ever. It not only had
                    great games, but industry developed at a pace which allowed
                    it to evolve to peaks that haven't been reached by other
                    consoles since.<BR><BR>
                    One of those games was named Rise of the Phoenix, Kouryuuki
                    in its japanese version. A very simple strategy game where
                    you chose one of two rulers, Xiang Yu or Liu Bang, and tried
                    to conquer China.<BR><BR>
                    There were better strategy games, though. However, this was
                    the first strategy game I ever played, and introduced me to
                    the chinese culture. And I thought, <i>Wouldn't it be great
                    if anybody could write a strategy game about his or her own
                    country, or about a fantasy world?</i><br><br>

                    is my most advanced game. Of course, it is unfinished. I
                    decided to apply all my knowledge in several areas in a
                    board game.
